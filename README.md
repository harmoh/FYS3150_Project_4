Project 4 in FYS3150 Computational Physics

Abstract:
This project simulated phase transitions in magnetic systems using the Ising model and the Metropolis algorithm. It was observed that the system reached an equilibrium after 1e6 Monte Carlo cycles and showed a phase transition at a temperature of T â‰ˆ 2.27 where it went from begin a system with a finite amount of magnetic moment to a system with zero magnetic moment.
